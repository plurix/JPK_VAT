# JPK_VAT
Polish SAF-T (Standard Audit File for Tax) verifier.
JPK_VAT(2) was introduced from January 1, 2017 by Polish Ministry of Finance to most companies in Poland. XSD specification was published for XML monthly reporting files for VAT registers. There're six other JPK file types (for other accounting books), which are not mandatory (only on request from tax authority starting from July 1, 2018). 

This program checks JPK_VAT(2) file prepared elsewhere for syntax correctness and some obvious semantic errors (missed or duplicated data, wrong entries, inconsistencies betw. registers and so on); prints monthly tax statements (VAT-7, VAT-UE, VAT-27) based on analysed data. 

The language chosen is plain Ruby (without Rails) with appropriate gems (BigDecimal, REXML,...).
# Quick Start Guide
- **JPK_VAT.rb** is the (complete) Ruby program, 
- **JPK_VAT.exe** is Windows executable (created by OCRA).

Program asks for name of input XML file, reads and analyses it - producing general log file (JPK.LOG) and several printout files (.PRN): details of VAT registers analysed (JSPyyyymm.PRN, JZAyyyymm.PRN), also generates tax statement declarations (JV7yyyymm.PRN, JVUEyyyymm.PRN, JV27yyyymm.PRN). Current version also dumps VAT registers created in a form appropriate to re-read into Ruby program using **source**.
